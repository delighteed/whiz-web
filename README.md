# Whiz | Gentle Focus & Cognitive Sustainability

Whiz is a privacy-first, AI-powered nudge designed to observe your fatigue, not you. It signals your nervous system to rest before you reach the point of burnout.

## The Problem
In the modern knowledge economy, work is entirely cognitive, yet we still measure it with industrial-era tools. When we push past our natural ultradian rhythms, our efficiency plummets. **Burnout isn't a failure of will—it's a failure of recovery.**

## The Solution
Whiz uses standard, non-invasive physiological signals to help you tune into your own body. By monitoring subtle cues in real-time, Whiz identifies the precise moment your cognitive battery begins to drain.

### Core Features
- **Blink Rate Monitoring**: Detects "computer vision syndrome" and ocular strain by tracking blink frequency and duration.
- **Focus Duration Tracking**: Measures intense focus periods to suggest micro-breaks before cognitive plateaus occur.
- **Postural Slump Detection**: Identifies physiological fatigue through changes in head position and shoulder drop.

## Privacy by Design
Your privacy is non-negotiable. Whiz is built on a "local-first" architecture:
- **Local Processing**: All computer vision analysis happens directly in your browser.
- **No Data Storage**: Video frames, images, and audio are never recorded or sent to a server.
- **Total Control**: Camera access must be granted explicitly and can be revoked at any time.

## Technology Stack
Built with high-performance modern web technologies:
- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- **UI & Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Animations**: [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
- **Icons**: [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/)
- **AI Intelligence**: [OpenAI GPT-4o-mini](https://openai.com/) (for site assistant logic)
